# Stafford Results Cleaned
Data Cleaning in Python for the 2016-2020 (up to September 4th, 2020) Stafford Motor Speedway SK Modified Race Results

### Context

I wanted to create this dataset in memory of my uncle Ted Christopher who is the all time most winningest driver at [Stafford Motor Speedway](https://staffordmotorspeedway.com/skmodified/) and tragically passed away in a plane crash on September 16th, 2017. [Ted's Business: M&T Enterprises](https://www.mandtenterprises.com/). 

### Content

This dataset contains all the race results for the SK Modified Feature races at Stafford Motor Speedway from the 2016 til the most recent update of this dataset. The data was acquired by using python web scraping tools to scrape Stafford's website along with other tools in python to clean the data. The data is stored in [sk_final.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/jmannix3/stafford-motor-speedway-sk-modified-race-results?select=sk_final.csv).

### Acknowledgements

Thank you to Scott Running who posts the results of every race on Stafford's website.

### Inspiration

One question I would like to know is: 
If Ted Christopher was still racing past September 16, 2017 how likely would he have been to win each race?
How less likely would other drivers be likely to win?
